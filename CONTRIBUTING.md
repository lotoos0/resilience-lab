# Contributing to Resilience Lab

## Commit Convention

All commits should follow the `[DAY##]` prefix format:

```
[DAY01] Add initial API service structure
[DAY02] Implement payment processing logic
[DAY15] Add Prometheus metrics integration
```

This helps track progress against the project timeline.

## Pull Requests

- **1 PR = 1 day of work**
- PRs map to daily milestones in the project plan
- Code review is **optional** but encouraged
- Self-merge is allowed after basic checks pass

## Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with `[DAY##]` commits
3. Push and create PR
4. Wait for CI checks (lint, test, build)
5. Merge when ready

## Questions?

Check the project plan in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN_PL.md` for milestone details.
