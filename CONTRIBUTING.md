## ðŸ§­ Branching Workflow

This project follows a **light GitFlow model**:

- `main` â†’ stable, production-ready releases only (tagged)
- `develop` â†’ active development branch (daily work and integration)
- `feature/<name>` â†’ new functionality or task for the current milestone
- `release/<version>` â†’ final polish and testing before tagging a release
- `hotfix/<name>` â†’ quick fix for urgent issues in production

Example:

```

feature/helm-ci
release/v0.1.0
hotfix/missing-envoy-config

```

---

## ðŸ§± Commit Convention

All commits must follow the `[DAY##]` prefix format:

```

[DAY01] Add initial API service structure
[DAY02] Implement payment processing logic
[DAY15] Add Prometheus metrics integration

```

This keeps progress traceable and aligned with the project timeline.

## ðŸ”€ Pull Requests

- **1 PR = 1 logical unit of work** (usually one day or milestone subtask)
- Target branch: `develop`
- Ensure CI checks (lint, test, build) pass before merging
- Self-merge allowed if:
  - CI is âœ… green
  - Code is tested locally
  - README or docs updated when relevant

## ðŸš€ Release Flow

1. Create `release/<version>` branch from `develop`
2. Finalize docs, CHANGELOG, and version bump
3. Merge to `main` using `--no-ff`
4. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```
5. Merge `main` back to `develop` to keep branches in sync
